# Pomodoro — a calmer, prettier focus timer

We built this because we were tired of utilitarian timers that felt like spreadsheets; this one puts focus first with a clean dial, subtle motion, and tasteful audio cues. Set your focus and break lengths, hit play, and let it auto-switch cycles while the animated ring and big tabular time keep your brain in the zone. Breaks get a soft, ambient backdrop; focus mode stays minimal and dark. Built with React, Framer Motion, Tailwind, and the Web Audio API.

## Features
- Editable focus/break durations with smooth auto-switching
- Play/Pause and Skip controls with crisp, low-key sounds
- Large animated dial + readable, tabular MM:SS
- Light “break” ambience; distraction-free “focus” look
- Works even if you switch tabs (timer uses wall-clock time)

## Quick start
```bash
# clone then:
npm install
npm run dev
# build for production:
npm run build
